Place the `CPM22.Z80` and `CPM22.ASM` files in this directory.

On a Linux system, you can download and extract the files like this:

```
wget http://www.cpm.z80.de/download/cpm2-asm.zip
unzip cpm2-asm.zip CPM22.Z80
```

Note that a `Makefile` has been created that will do the download and unzip the source as needed.
Therefore all you need to do is type `make` in this directory.
